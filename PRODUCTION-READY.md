## 🎸 The Manifesto

Your new manifesto is live in the info modal:

> **KILLGORITHM — Manifesto**
> 
> Killgorithm is not nostalgia.
> It's not a brand.
> It's the rupture point — where distortion becomes philosophy and rhythm becomes revolt...

**Technically complete. Humanly unfinished.**

**Questions or issues?** Deploy first, then we can iterate based on live feedback!
